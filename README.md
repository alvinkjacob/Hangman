# Python-Practise

I have uploaded onto this repository some of the little games that I made while practising how to code in Python. There is also a password generator in there. 

Guessing Game One - The computer thinks of a number in a range, and you have to type in your guesses for it. It will tell you whether your guess was too high, too low, or correct.

Guessing Game Two - This time you think of a number. And the computer guesses what number it is. I have to admit, the way that I have coded the computer to guess isn't an efficient method :/ 

Hangman - The typical game of hangman between two people. Instead of drawring a hanging man everytime a player guesses the wrong letter, you are alloted ten lives.

Password Generator - This is the only one that is not a game. This code will generate a randomly generated password for you consisting of letters, numbers and symbols, according to whatever strength you want i.e. weak, medium or strong.

Rock Paper Scissors - This is the typical game of rock paper scissors between two players. 

Tic Tac Toe -  This is the game of tic-tac-toe or you might call it noughts-and-crosses. You will be asked to place your X or O onto the grid (a grid will be displayed in the terminal, made from lists within a list) in the form of a coordinate i.e. row,column.
